# go-rpm [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cavaliercoder/go-rpm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cavaliercoder/go-rpm) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/cavaliercoder/go-rpm?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/cavaliercoder/go-rpm)

A native implementation of the RPM file specification in Go.

	$ go get github.com/cavaliercoder/go-rpm


The go-rpm package aims to enable cross-platform tooling for yum/dnf/rpm
written in Go (E.g. [y10k](https://github.com/cavaliercoder/y10k)).

Initial goals include like-for-like implementation of existing rpm ecosystem
features such as:

* Reading of modern and legacy rpm package file formats
* Reading, creating and updating modern and legacy yum repository metadata
* Reading of the rpm database

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/cavaliercoder/go-rpm"
)

func main() {
	p, err := rpm.OpenPackageFile("golang-1.6.3-2.el7.rpm")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Loaded package: %v - %s\n", p, p.Summary())

	// Output: golang-0:1.6.3-2.el7.x86_64 - The Go Programming Language
}
```
